Here is a short list of books that I've found very helpful in getting better at programming and software engineering.

- **[Effective Java by Joshua Bloch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105099.Effective_Java_Programming_Language_Guide)** - Probably the best book on Java ever written

- **[Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)** - Possibly the best treatise on what it means to write good code

- **[Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture)** - Uncle Bob's follow-up book, where he discusses how good design scales to the architectural level

- **[Design Patterns by Gamma, Johnson & Vlissides](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns)** - How to solve common problems in very smart ways

- **[Refactoring by Martin Fowler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring)** - The definitive text on improving existing code (including yours, as you write it)

- **[Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12544648-cracking-the-coding-interview)** - A good introduction to algorithmic thinking, though it does not represent all interview processes
