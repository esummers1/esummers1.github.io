# Exercises

## Zoo

Implement a Zoo class to hold a collection of Animals. Animals should have names and a record of the number of legs they have. Zoo should have the following methods:
- Get total number of legs
- Get descriptions of all animals

A description might be something like "Brutal gorilla named [name]".

For bonus points, make Animal abstract and add subclasses for the species in your Zoo.

## FootballSimulator

Implement a League where each Team (consisting of Players) plays every other Team. Players should have "ratings", and a Team with a higher total player rating should win when playing a Team with a lower total rating.

League should allow Main to call a `play` method or similar, in which the whole league is played, and a table of results is returned.

For bonus points, make it so that a higher total player rating does not guarantee victory, but makes it more likely.
